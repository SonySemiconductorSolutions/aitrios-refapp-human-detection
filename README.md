## Overview

This repository provides a reference implementation of a full solution using AITRIOS™. Building up on top of an existing AI model and Edge app, this reference solution implements human detection solutions such as people counting, people counting in regions and heatmap.
It consists of a Backend that interacts with Console for AITRIOS using the Console's REST API that is paired with a UI that retrieves the meta-data from the Console for AITRIOS and displays the image together with the detected objects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Human Detection Application, follow the steps below.

### Prepare a device on AITRIOS Console

To run this reference solution you need to have a CSV26 camera to be enrolled to your project in the AITRIOS Console. In addition, it should have deployed a human detection Edge application and a compatible object detection AI model. These artifacts should first be obtained locally, then imported to the Console and finally be deployed on device.

> _Note_ </br>
> For basic device and console operation, please refer to the [**Device Setup Guide**](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/documents/device-setup-guide/) and [**Console User Manual**](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/documents/console-user-manual/).

#### Create and deploy artifacts

The reference solution requires a model and an edge application to be deployed on the device. In some cases, the process for obtaining and deploying these artifacts varies between versions of Console for AITRIOS, V1 and V2. When applicable, such difference is directly indicated in further description.

##### AI Model

- In order to obtain the AI model for object detection, check the [**Console V2 Downloads**](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/downloads/console-v2). You will obtain an Object Detection model (based on SSD MobileNet) as a zip file that will need to be imported to the AITRIOS Console and then deployed to the device.

  > **NOTE**<br>
  > The AI model is downloaded from Console V2 Downloads, but can be used with both V1 and V2 Console versions.

- For instructions on how to import an AI model into **Console V2** and deploy it to the device, check [**Console V2 User Manual**](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/documents/console-v2/console-user-manual).

- For instructions on how to import an AI model into **Console V1** and deploy it to the device, check [**Console V1 User Manual**](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/documents/console-user-manual).

  > **NOTE**<br>
  > When importing the AI model, make sure to check the "Converted Model" checkbox as this is a converted model file.

##### Edge Application

- In order to get the Edge Application, check the [**Downloads**](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/downloads). Please select from V1 or V2 according to the Console you wish to use. You will obtain an Edge Application that will need to be imported to the AITRIOS Console and then deployed to the device.

  > **NOTE**<br>
  > Note that for V1 the Edge Application artifact would be a single file of type `.wasm`/`.aot`, while V2 would result in an Edge Application Package.

-  For instructions on how to import an Edge Application into **Console**, and how to deploy it to the device check [**Console User Manual**](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/documents/console-user-manual/).


#### Configure the Edge Application

**v1: Import and Bind Command Parameter File**

To control the device's inference operation, a Command Parameter file must be bound to the device. While a user can provide an initial command parameter file themselves through the Console, it is not necessary since the current application automatically creates a new Command Parameter file and binds it to a selected device in case when no initial is available. [**Console User Manual**](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/documents/console-user-manual/) provides instructions on importing Command Parameter file into **Console**, and on binding Command Parameter to the device.

**v2: update Edge Application state with DTDL**

Starting from version 2, AITRIOS is using DTDL (short for "Digital Twins Definition Language") to define the Edge Application Interface. While there
are numerous configurations, the reference solution requires only some of them to be specified. In particular, one has to correctly configure the port settings that define methods and a storage for the upload of the edge application output. They correspond to the content of the field `edge_app.common_settings.port_settings`.

To do so, you first need to obtain the ID of your project (`YOUR_PROJECT_ID`) from AITRIOS Portal and specify it in the "storage_name" for the "input_tensor" field. You can find `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` in the browser url on the website of the portal, after logging in and selecting a project. The browser url takes the form `PORTAL_URL/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/marketplace/product`.

You can then apply the following configuration to the Edge Application deployed on Console.
```json
{
  "edge_app": {
    "common_settings": {
      "port_settings": {
        "metadata": {
          "path": "",
          "method": 0,
          "enabled": true,
          "endpoint": "",
          "storage_name": ""
        },
        "input_tensor": {
          "path": "YOUR_DEVICE_ID/image/FOLDER_NAME",
          "method": 1,
          "enabled": true,
          "endpoint": "",
          "storage_name": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
        }
      }
  }
}
```

> **Note**<br/>
> For general details on the Edge Application interface, check the [Edge Application Interface JSON Specification](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/documents/console-v2/edge-application-interface-json-specification) page on the AITRIOS developer website. Pay attention to the [`port_settings` subsection](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/documents/console-v2/edge-application-interface-json-specification?progLang=#_portsettingsSpec) <br/>
> For details on the custom settings for the Edge Application, check its [README.md](https://github.com/SonySemiconductorSolutions/aitrios-sdk-edge-app/tree/main/sample_apps/detection#custom-parameters).

### Local Installation

**Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SonySemiconductorSolutions/aitrios-sample-application-human-detection.git
cd aitrios-sample-application-human-detection
```

#### Running the Application

To run the full application, use the provided Docker Compose setup:

```bash
docker compose up
```

To run only the backend or frontend separately, execute:


```bash
docker compose up backend
```
```bash
docker compose up frontend
```

>  **Note**</br>
> This approach doesn't support debugging. To run app in the debugging mode you should start frontend and backend separately.
